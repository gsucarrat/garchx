Version 1.1 (TBA):
==================

* garchx:
- c.code argument: new default TRUE
- new argument: vcov.type
- the arch and garch orders changed place in the order argument, i.e. order[1] now refers to the garch order, and order[2] now refers to the arch order

* garchxRecursion: improved speed when the garch order is 1 or greater, since the function now calls compiled c-code for the recursion

* garchxAvar: new function, computes the asymptotic coefficient-covariance of a model by simulation

* garchxObjective: minor changes for improved numerical robustness

* vcov.garchx: new argument vcov.type

* fitted.garchx: new argument as.zoo (logical)

* residuals.garchx: new argument as.zoo (logical)

* new functions:
- nobs.garchx
- quantile.garchx
- toLatex.garchx

* fixes:
 - vcov.garchx: now works when verbose=FALSE in the garchx object it is applied to
 - print.garchx: now works when verbose=FALSE in the garchx object it is applied to


Version 1.0 (7 April 2020):
===========================

First version. The version numbering '1.0' means the release is considered to be fairly stable and well-tested.
